CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Return maximum 8 recommendations, ranked by overall_score descending
2. Consider the waiting_tolerance_days: heavily penalize time_fit_score if crop_cycle_days exceeds it
3. Use the contextual weather and market data to influence season_score and market_score
4. Confidence_pct should be reduced if sensor data is incomplete (no pH, EC, NPK sensors)
5. Risk_score should account for typhoon season, pest outbreaks, and market saturation from context
6. All financial figures must be realistic for Philippines 2025 and scaled to farmer's land_size_ha
7. Consider the current month (11) and ensure harvest doesn't coincide with worst weather
8. Respect budget constraint strictly - do not recommend crops where estimated_cost_php > budget_php
